# nba_salary_analysis

I am a huge fan of NBA. My favorite NBA star used to be lebron james, now it is stephen curry.

Are NBA palyers' salaries comparable to his market value?  Are any NBA players paid equal to the market for their services? More interestingly, what factors explain how salaries are set in the NBA? In this project, I seek to answer these questions.

Analysis done in Python, inluding web scrapping, data visualisation and Simple Linear Regression
