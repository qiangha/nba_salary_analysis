# nba_salary_analysis

Increasingly, NBA players have come under intense scrutiny for their large salaries. Many questions have been asked, including why they are paid what they are and how are salary decisions made.
In this notebook, I aim to find out what factors explain how salaries are set in the NBA and use 2016-2017 data to predict the salary a player will earn 2017-2018. This notebook will serve as a first step in justifying/defying the high salaries given to NBA players.
